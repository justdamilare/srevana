In December 2020 - the year of the great pandemic :sunglasses:, I made my decision to pivot my focus to being a Site Reliability Engineer (SRE). 

## What is Site Reliability Engineering?

Perhaps Red Hat put it most elegantly:

> Site reliability engineering (SRE) is a software engineering approach to IT operations. SRE teams use software as a tool to manage systems, solve problems, and automate operations tasks.

The concept started in Google in the 2003. Site Reliablity Engineers take tasks that had previosuly been undertaken by ops teams, and then they automate those tasks. There's been some debate about the difference between SRE and DevOps. Personally, I don't think there's any major difference, I just think SRE sounds much better.

## I created a board

I created a [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/k8IaYLzf) to track what I have to learn.  Anyone who visits the Trello board will see how ignorant I am and how much work I have to do.

I started this blog to document my journey to being an SRE. I will be talking about the things I learn and the challenges I face. I sincerely hope this is of help to anyone who visits.
